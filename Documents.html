<h4>What is the background of the Christmas Meeting described in the text?</h4>

<p>The Christmas Meeting described in the text is held in Wanganui, New Zealand, on Christmas Day, which is midsummer in the country. It is attended by numerous Native Christians of different tribes who gather to unite in prayer, praise, and receive instruction from their Minister, Rev. R. Taylor. The Meeting of 1849 was attended by a large congregation and was deeply interesting. The day began with a morning service, and after breakfast, about 2000 Christian Native assembled in the open air, in God's own temple. The Meeting was held to hear a Letter addressed to the Church Missionary Society read to them, and to reply to it. The Letter was sent by the Society to all parts of the world where they were spreading the Gospel, and the Meeting was held to confirm their faith and interest their hearts in the same glorious cause.</p>

<p>Tamahana Te Rauparaha, a New Zealand chief, left England and his friends there to return to his native land. He had learned about Christianity from a youth who had attended a Missionary school and brought back a copy of the New Zealand Testament. Tamahana learned to read and brought the first Missionary to his tribe, which resulted in most of them becoming Christians. He believed in the importance of giving his people useful occupations to prevent them from being idle and causing fights. Tamahana wanted to build a town like the white man's, which the people initially thought would be difficult, but he convinced them to try. They first built the church, then their houses. Tamahana burned the old houses in the old pa and asked his people to make their houses English style, with two rooms and a chimney and only one family to live in each house. Tamahana also bought a cow, which he milked every day, and he tried to make butter without any English to teach him. Tamahana was committed to helping his people and improving their character and habits.</p>

<p>Tamahana Te Rauparaha, a New Zealand chief, aimed to introduce English ways to his people and improve their condition. He purchased plates, knives, cups, saucers, sugar, and tea with the money he earned from selling pigs in Wellington. He organized a feast where the people were amazed by the new food and utensils. Tamahana encouraged them to adopt English customs, including wearing English clothes and using plates, knives, and forks. He emphasized the importance of discarding bad habits and customs and embracing positive changes. Tamahana also inspired his community to raise funds for a water mill and successfully collected money through various means, including selling produce and working for the English. They eventually established a bakery, a butcher, and a clothing store in their town. Furthermore, Tamahana and his father led the construction of a large church made of the strong and beautiful totara wood, taking two and a half years to complete. Tamahana's next goal was to establish a college to educate promising individuals as catechists and schoolmasters, aiming to promote instruction and Christianity among the native people. He intended to present his plans to the Committee of the Society in England.</p>

<p>After completing various projects for the improvement of his people, including the construction of a new town and a large church, Tamahana's father, Rauparaha, fell ill and passed away. Tamahana had a heartfelt conversation with his father before his death, discussing faith and the importance of love between the Maori and English communities. With his father's passing, Tamahana felt compelled to visit England to witness the origins of the gospel and bring back knowledge and goodness to his people. His desire to go to England grew stronger, and when he learned that Mr. Williams was also traveling there, he saw it as a sign from God. He consulted his minister, Mr. Hadfield, who encouraged him to pursue his wish. Despite the reluctance of his wife and people, Tamahana believed it was his duty to go and trusted that God would take care of his people in his absence. He entrusted Martyn and Hakaraia to look after the community in his stead and urged them to obey his minister. Tearful farewells were exchanged, and on October 24, 1850, Tamahana left Otaki with his wife accompanying him to Wellington. From there, he embarked on the "John Wesley" ship on December 21, bidding a sorrowful goodbye to his beloved homeland. The details of his experiences in England and his reflections on the journey will be shared in a subsequent publication.</p>
