<h3>Insights</h3>

<p>We are going to take a dive into Tamihana Te Rauparaha's life. This website features a first hand account from Taminaha Te Rauparaha as he goes on a missionary trip to England. Using the website One More Voice to put together a timeline of his life. One More Voice is a unique and invaluable resource that didn’t use to be available until recently. This website allows for exploring the diverse and underrepresented voices of the past. You get a first hand account from a perspective that use to be hidden. This website focuses on restoring these stories. I think One More Voice allows for a deeper and more focused exploration of slavery through the correct voices. I picked five with the same headings just different dates. The “Tamahana Te Rauparaha” were all periodical pieces from the website.
